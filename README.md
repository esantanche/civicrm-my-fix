# Fixing a bug in CiviCRM

I fixed a bug in CiviCRM (https://civicrm.org/).

The fixed file is /CRM/Utils/Mail/EmailProcessor.php.

Find line 163 in that file.

The story of how I found and fixed the bug is here: http://emanuelesantanche.com/bounce-processing-when-smtp-server-doesnt-return-bounces-properly/
